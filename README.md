Not paradoxically, it is the only song that I have written in prison. I have written much in prison but no title figure on the album to hand that there. As I did not have the prods, it was more complicated to write. Often, I was listening to the prods cain-ri and I wrote above. I was the hand in fact. But mostly I made the sport. I wanted to take a little remote music The error that I made it is Karim Zenoud who pay, this is not Lacrim.

How was the collaboration with Lil Durk and French Montana found in featuring on your album ?

In the same way except that French Montana has asked in Paris. Lil Durk It is organized in the United States, in his studio but at a distance. As I still had my bracelet, I have not been able to make the move. I am very satisfied with these two featurings.

Thou hast already other projects in preparation?

I already work on my Mixtape. I work with prods more extensive, I am less select. I cannot yet give dates, but there will be featurings and tips of the insane. I had done another feat with Mister You. But we were all two not hyper convinced by the title.

On social networks, we see that thou hast a community hyper young person who follows you (16 to 18 years) while your lyrics are very dark. How thou do explain?

I am not in agreement. It is wrong to know me to say that I have that young people behind me. Young people are without doubt more visible than my Fans aged 30 to 40 years. This is especially the teens who post comments on my Facebook page, for example.

What are you listening to as French rap?

When I listen to the HBP french, I am rather nostalgic. French rap for me it is an entity, I must find in the texts. The Rat Luciano c is the perfect example. When I was listening to younger, I found myself totally in his words. I had chills in the back. It is for that that I made several feat with him as soon as I could.

We feel that there are many references to the cinema of gangsters in your texts. That is where you get the inspiration?

Yes I m inspired by the classics. The films of Scorcese, of Palma. Series level, I have watched the Soprano but I am rather the wire, Mafiosa and especially Corleone which remains my favorite series.

The title Oz is more emotional, less black that other songs of rap on the prison. We think in particular to "The letter" of lunatic

It is a song that I like very much. In 2000, when it is released, I was in prison. What Booba recounted returned directly in resonance with what I could live. It is a very big title, it is obvious.

>> Face Camera, Lacrim tells its prison Diving


Why have entitled One of thy songs of the name of the television series Oz?

This song gives an account of the prison universe. I tell the story that I saw during my last incarceration. After I am not hyper fan of the television series, I saw that a few episodes. I reused the name of the series in order to understand that we are talking about prison. But in fact when you listen, this is not at all like that and you take a pie…

The violence described by the series is it realistic in relation to what thou hast known?

In the jail where I was we were more than 1000 prisoners. The prison was overloaded. By Cell, we were 2 or 3 sometimes. Some were asleep by earth. Need to know that when thou hast 1000 prisoners, thou hast always 200 sheep and 800 wolves. To survive, must be a wolf. Everyone walking with a knife to protect themselves. It must always be on its guard. In prison, thy heart, thou the leashes at the Registry… 
The rapper of Orly continues to say its truths. His new album "Mouhamad Alix" concatenates the strong titles with watermark, the fight against racism, the elites in carton and the place of rappers in the society.
On this new album, and, as often, you appointed people that thou dénonces. Guerlain, Lesquen, Guént, Copé, Balkany, Desire, Juppé… Your texts are always anchored very concretely in the actu. You consider the rap like a media ?

Kery James - has the origin, I wanted to become a journalist. Or lawyer. So I tried to gather all these trades which I would have been interested in my music. At the beginning, the rappers were a little of journalists, but journalists of the ghetto. When NTM has written the World of Tomorrow in 1991 to describe the segregation in the suburbs, there was no mention of it. It was necessary that they tell this reality that most of the French were unaware. I think that is our role. It is the media. The only ones who have really tried to assume this role in the music, at a certain time, it was us. Even if this is much less the case today.



There is precisely not evil of rappers who refuse this side spokesman now...

Yes, it has become almost a tare, the guys are happy not to be door-words. Bah me, when I have known the HBP, it was not like that. Public Enemy, KRS-ONE… I have always thought, naively, that it was a music which was to say things. In fact, I practice the rap that made me love the rap.



They are sometimes afraid of locking in a role and some journalists have a tendency to all the time to put them back in…

I understand, it is complicated. But it is one of the great problems of society in general. Nobody wants to wear of burden. The whole world expects that someone else to do it.

The young generation Lack of leaders?

There is a lack of leaders, models. I do not profess to be neither the one nor the other, but I try to be a man who has a little sense of justice and responsibility.

We feel that there are many references to the cinema of gangsters in your texts. That is where you get the inspiration?

Yes I m inspired by the classics. The films of Scorcese, of Palma. Series level, I have watched the Soprano but I am rather the wire, Mafiosa and especially Corleone which remains my favorite series.

We think in particular to "The letter" of lunatic

It is a song that I like very much. In 2000, when it is released, I was in prison. What Booba recounted returned directly in resonance with what I could live. It is a very big title, it is obvious.

>> Face Camera, Lacrim tells its prison Diving


Why have entitled One of thy songs of the name of the television series Oz?

This song gives an account of the prison universe. I tell the story that I saw during my last incarceration. After I am not hyper fan of the television series, I saw that a few episodes. I reused the name of the series in order to understand that we are talking about prison. But in fact when you listen, this is not at all like that and you take a pie…

The violence described by the series is it realistic in relation to what thou hast known?

In the jail where I was we were more than 1000 prisoners. The prison was overloaded. By Cell, we were 2 or 3 sometimes. Some were asleep by earth. Need to know that when thou hast 1000 prisoners, thou hast always 200 sheep and 800 wolves. To survive, must be a wolf. Everyone walking with a knife to protect themselves. It must always be on its guard. In prison, thy heart, thou the leashes at the Registry… 
The rapper of Orly continues to say its truths. His new album "Mouhamad Alix" concatenates the strong titles with watermark, the fight against racism, the elites in carton and the place of rappers in the society.
On this new album, and, as often, you appointed people that thou dénonces. Guerlain, Lesquen, Guént, Copé, Balkany, Desire, Juppé… Your texts are always anchored very concretely in the actu. You consider the rap like a media ?

Kery James - has the origin, I wanted to become a journalist. Or lawyer. So I tried to gather all these trades which I would have been interested in my music. At the beginning, the rappers were a little of journalists, but journalists of the ghetto. When NTM has written the World of Tomorrow in 1991 to describe the segregation in the suburbs, there was no mention of it. It was necessary that they tell this reality that most of the French were unaware. I think that is our role. It is the media. The only ones who have really tried to assume this role in the music, at a certain time, it was us. Even if this is much less the case today.



There is precisely not evil of rappers who refuse this side spokesman now...

Yes, it has become almost a tare, the guys are happy not to be door-words. Bah me, when I have known the HBP, it was not like that. Public Enemy, KRS-ONE… I have always thought, naively, that it was a music which was to say things. In fact, I practice the rap that made me love the rap.



They are sometimes afraid of locking in a role and some journalists have a tendency to all the time to put them back in…

I understand, it is complicated. But it is one of the great problems of society in general. Nobody wants to wear of burden. The whole world expects that someone else to do it.

The young generation Lack of leaders?

There is a lack of leaders, models. I do not profess to be neither the one nor the other, but I try to be a man who has a little sense of justice and responsibility.
